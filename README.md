# Clock App Exercise

Hi! Welcome to the real-time exercise of Neat's interview. 

**Please read all this file first**

## Configuration

The first thing is to configure your environment. To do this you need to follow the next steps:

1. Go to [React Native page](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), and follow the configuration steps of **React Native CLI Quickstart**, depending on your OS
and use Android as target OS.
  *If you have problems while installing the JDK you can manually download it at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/cl/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) and add manually the environment variable **JAVA_HOME**

2. Clone the git repository with `git clone https://github.com/javier-benavide/clock-app.git`

3. Install the dependencies with "yarn install" in the cloned repo

## Exercise

For the real-time exercise you need to build a mobile App with React Native and Typescript that 

show a visualization of a clock.

You will find more details of the exercise inside the file [App.tsx](https://github.com/javier-benavide/clock-app/blob/main/App.tsx)
